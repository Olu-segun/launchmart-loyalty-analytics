# LaunchMart Loyalty Analytics üõçÔ∏è

A SQL-based data analysis project for **LaunchMart**, a fictional retail loyalty platform, focusing on customer behavior, purchase patterns, and reward analytics. This project aims to provide actionable insights to improve the loyalty program's effectiveness and drive revenue growth.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Benefits

*   **Customer Segmentation:** Identify valuable customer segments based on purchase behavior.
*   **Purchase Pattern Analysis:** Understand product preferences and buying trends.
*   **Loyalty Program Effectiveness:** Measure the impact of loyalty programs on customer retention and spending.
*   **Revenue Forecasting:** Project future revenue based on historical trends.
*   **Actionable Insights:** Provide recommendations to improve the loyalty program and increase customer engagement.

## üß† Skills & Concepts Demonstrated

- SQL Aggregations (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`)
- Window Functions (`RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `PARTITION BY`)
- Date and Time Functions (`EXTRACT`, `AGE`, `INTERVAL`)
- Data Filtering with `HAVING`, `CASE WHEN`
- JOIN operations across multiple tables
- Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites & Dependencies

*   **SQL Database:** A relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.
*   **SQL Client:** A tool for executing SQL queries, like Dbeaver, SQL Developer, or pgAdmin.

## üöÄ Installation & Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Olu-segun/launchmart-loyalty-analytics.git
    cd launchmart-loyalty-analytics
    ```

2.  **Database Setup:**

    *   Create a new database named `launchmart_loyalty`.
    *   Execute the schema script (`01_schema.sql`) to create the required tables:

        ```bash
        # Example using PostgreSQL
        psql -U <username> -d launchmart_loyalty -f 01_schema.sql

        ```

3.  **Seed Data:**

    *   Populate the database with initial data using the seed data script (`02_seed_data.sql`):

        ```bash
        # Example using PostgreSQL
        psql -U <username> -d launchmart_loyalty -f 02_seed_data.sql

        ```

## üí° Usage Examples

1.  **Execute SQL Queries:**

    *   Use your preferred SQL client to connect to the `launchmart_loyalty` database.
    *   Open the `Solution.sql` file to find pre-written queries for analyzing the data.
    *   Execute the queries to gain insights into customer behavior, purchase patterns, and loyalty program effectiveness.

    ```sql
    
-- Example Query: Monthly Revenue Trend
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS month,
    SUM(total_amount) AS monthly_revenue
FROM orders
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) = 2023
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date)
ORDER BY month ASC;


    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Options

This project does not require extensive configuration. However, you can:

*   **Modify the Seed Data:** Customize the data in `02_seed_data.sql` to represent different customer segments, product categories, or loyalty program rules.
*   **Adjust SQL Queries:** Adapt the queries in `Solution.sql` to explore specific business questions or KPIs.
