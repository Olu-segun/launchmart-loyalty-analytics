## üöÄ Installation & Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Olu-segun/launchmart-loyalty-analytics.git
    cd launchmart-loyalty-analytics
    ```

2.  **Database Setup:**

    *   Create a new database named `launchmart_loyalty`.
    *   Execute the schema script (`01_schema.sql`) to create the required tables:

        ```bash
        # Example using MySQL
        mysql -u <username> -p launchmart_loyalty < 01_schema.sql
        ```

3.  **Seed Data:**

    *   Populate the database with initial data using the seed data script (`02_seed_data.sql`):

        ```bash
        # Example using MySQL
        mysql -u <username> -p launchmart_loyalty < 02_seed_data.sql
        ```

## üí° Usage Examples

1.  **Execute SQL Queries:**

    *   Use your preferred SQL client to connect to the `launchmart_loyalty` database.
    *   Open the `Solution.sql` file to find pre-written queries for analyzing the data.
    *   Execute the queries to gain insights into customer behavior, purchase patterns, and loyalty program effectiveness.

    ```sql
    -- Example Query from Solution.sql
    SELECT
        DATE_TRUNC('month', transaction_date) AS transaction_month,
        SUM(transaction_amount) AS monthly_revenue
    FROM
        transactions
    GROUP BY
        transaction_month
    ORDER BY
        transaction_month;
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Options

This project does not require extensive configuration. However, you can:

*   **Modify the Seed Data:** Customize the data in `02_seed_data.sql` to represent different customer segments, product categories, or loyalty program rules.
*   **Adjust SQL Queries:** Adapt the queries in `Solution.sql` to explore specific business questions or KPIs.
